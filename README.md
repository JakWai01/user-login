# An industry-standard user login :closed_lock_with_key:
This application is an industry-standard user login to use as a template for logins (I do not guarantee that is is the most secure method though). The user credentials aren't stored in any variable at any point. The passwords AND the usernames will be transformed into hashcode and stored in a database afterwards.
